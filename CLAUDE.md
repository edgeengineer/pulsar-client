I want to create a Cross Platform Swift 6.1 Client for Apple and Linux systems for Apache Pulsar. This swift package should be called PulsarClient

1. Clone https://github.com/apache/pulsar-dotpulsar which is the Apache Pulsar Client for local reference. This is a C# Client Client
2. Create a plan for porting the C# dotnet SDK to Swift 
3. Begin porting while building tests in Swift using Swift Testing (don't use XCTest)
